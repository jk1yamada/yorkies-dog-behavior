## Website Project
A project I will be working on is to create a website for dogsitting services. I need to start using agile methods either kanban or scrum to schedule my dogsitting appointments and daily schedule.

## Alarms Project
Gregory will be creating a program to set alarms for times when Benji usually participates in his routines, so as to predict his actions and make his companions' lives easier.
